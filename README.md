Cooleaf iOS Application
=======================

How to test?
------------

Application is normally connected to sandbox environment on http://sandbox.cooleaf.com
You are able to change that endpoint to staging by going to iPhone settings, finding Cooleaf app settings and switching the development staging environment switch.

Be aware that there is an edge case scenario where this causes application to show wrong values (just after the switch). To fix this you need to kill the app from task switcher.
